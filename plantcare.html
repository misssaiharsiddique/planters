                    <p>watering right amount of water is essential part of the plant care. Over or under watered soil can damage plant's root and stop their growth. Before watering your plants always determine whether your plant need water or not. This can be determine by sticking your finger into the soil. If the soil is damp then you do not require watring you plant but if it feels dry, you can water your plant. Remember! this trick works for most plants but not all of them therefore its best to know some basics about your plant. Some plants can also be determined by their appearance. If plant looks yellow in colour and dry when you touch it then its means plant is under watered. If plant is too soft and have black leaves then it is the signof over watered plant. </p>

                   <p>Just like humans, Plants can also suffer from nutritional deficiencies. If your plant's leaves are turning yellow then it is likely that it sufferes from chlorosis which mean it is lacking particular or several nutrient needs. Therefore, Fertilizers are a good way to cater your plants nutrition needs. Frequency of fertilizing plants depend on your plant type but most plants need fertilizer from two weeks to 3 months time apart from winter as indoor plant growth slows in winter so it does not require fertilizers. </p>
